bash script to change Pulseaudio's output stream

Surprisingly, there isn't, to my knowledege, a simple way or command to switch Pulseaudio's output stream. This means you have to install pavucontrol, launch it, and navigate through the UI to, for example, play music through your speakers instead of your USB headset, which is extremely inconvenient, especially if your workflow is keyboard-driven. 

This is a dumb script I wrote to do it easily. It can also be bound to a keybind to switch quickly between different audio outputs.
